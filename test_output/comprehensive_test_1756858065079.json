This is achieved through methods like synthesizing data into a problem statement and employing personas and journey mapping to outline user requirements. \n\nThe key tools used in this phase include thematic analysis, personas, and journey maps. Thematic analysis helps in organizing and interpreting the data. Personas represent the users to help understand their needs, experiences, behaviors, and goals. Journey maps illustrate the process that a user goes through to achieve a goal.\n\nThe outcome of the Define phase is a design brief. This is a document that gives a clear and focused direction for developing solutions. It encapsulates the problem statement and user requirements based on the insights gathered from the data.",
